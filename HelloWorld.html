<!-- This is a comment in HTML. -->

<!-- In a HTML document, you always begin by telling the browser what version of HTML you will be using. HTML5 is the
current standard, so we will use that: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- "But wait", you say, "that just says HTML, not HTML5!" As it turns out, that IS how you set the document to be HTML5.
Simple, huh? -->

<!-- In HTML, you wrap almost everything in tags. Here is the opening tag for the <head> of the document. If you skip down
to line #58 you will see how we close it. -->
<head>
<!-- Inside the <head> area is where you place everyhting BUT the actual content of the page. You will put things like
javascript and CSS in here, as well as the page title (the text that will appear on the browser tab). In fact, let's do
that right now: -->
	<title>HTML and CSS "Hello World"</title>
<!-- Let's place a little bit of CSS in here. You will need to wrap it in a pair of <style> tags (just like <head>). -->
	<style>
	/* This is a CSS comment. Because we are in the <style> area, this will all get parsed as CSS */
	
	/* CSS is how you style HTML elements. Let's break this bit of CSS down:*/
		body {
			background-color: #2D2D2D;
		}
		/* The first part (body) is a "selector". This is the part of a CSS statment that tells the browser what to 
		apply the styling to. In this case, we will be styling the background color of the <body> tag that begins on
		line 61.
		
		Then, inside the curly brackets, and before the colon, we have the "property". There are a LOT of different 
		CSS properties, here's a pretty full list: http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/. 
		
		After the property, we have the value. Depending on the property, this could be a Hex color code, a px 
		value, or even some other weird stuff.
		
		Always remember to place a colon between the property ("background-color") and the value ("#2D2D2D"), then 
		put a semicolon after the value and before the next property (if you have more than one). */
	
		/* Here's some more CSS, feel free to mess with it! */
		h1 {
			color: #C26356; /* setting the text color */
			font-size: 30px; /* setting the size of the font */
			font-family: Menlo, Monaco, fixed-width;
		}
		
		/* You will notice that the font-family property has a fancy value. This allows you to set your preferred 
		font, followed by a list of comma seperated fall-backs in case the host computer does not have the preferred
		font installed. In this case, I'm telling it to use Menlo, but if it doesn't have that font, to use Monaco, 
		and if it doesn't have that one, to just used any fixed-width font. */
		
		/* Now, I'll style the <p> tag */
		p {
			color: white;
			font-family: "Source Code Pro", Menlo, Monaco, fixed-width;
		}
		/* And wrap it up by closing the <style> tag with it's mate: */
	</style>
	
<!-- Back to HTML comments! We have now put everything we need in the <head> tag, so let's close it... -->	
</head>

<!-- ...and open the <body> tag. Inside it is where we place the actual content, hurray! -->
<body>
	
	<!-- Let's start the page with a <h1>. h1 signifies that this is the main "header" for the page, and should briefly
	describe the content of the page.-->
	<h1>Hello World Example</h1>
	
	<!-- Now, we will write a paragraph of text. Because this is just a normal paragraph, will will wrap it in the <p> 
	tag (p is for paragraph). -->
	<p>This is a very basic "Hello World" example made up in HTML and CSS. See if you can change the size of the header text above.</p>
	
	<!-- Last but not least, we can't forget to close the <body> and <html> tags! -->
</body>
</html>

<!-- See, that wasn't that bad, now was it? If you've used Freeway, you already have a huge head-start as you likly know
all the CSS properties and values you will need (at least at first). -->
